# NYTimes
Build a simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles, that shows details when items on the list are tapped (a typical master/detail app). You should use either Android (Kotlin).

I am using Model–view–ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern and Some of Android Jetpack Components
